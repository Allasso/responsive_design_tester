## Responsive Design Tester
Tests responsive design layouts in viewer with selectable viewport sizes

Allows the dev manipulation of viewports configurations to test responsive design pages to give an idea of its rendering.  Configurations can be changed manually or from a menu of configurations for common devices.

This is primarily designed for the development process where pages/viewport configurations can be updated and tested quickly.  This is not intended to take the place of actual testing on mobile devices which I recommend doing before putting your page into production.

[BrowserStack](http://browserstack.com) offers tools which tests pages on actual mobile devices.
